pqRand: The precise quantile random package
	version 0.3 (May 2017)
By Keith Pedersen (Keith.David.Pedersen @ gmail.com)
	https://github.com/keith-pedersen/pqRand
	https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07949

Special thanks to Zack Sullivan, Andrew Webster and Sebastiano Vigna.

This package is designed to improve sampling from the following distributions
========================================================================
	* normal
	* log-normal
	* exponential
	* weibull
	* pareto
	
WARNING
========================================================================
	This package is newly released and under active development. 
	As of 11 May 2017, there is still no stable release of version 0.3.x
	Upon stable release, a development branch will be forked, 
	and version 0.3.x will be tagged.

ATTENTION
========================================================================
	This package uses C++11. Hopefully by now (2017), 
	C++11 is supported at your site. My apologies if it is not, 
	but there are SO many reasons to use it.
	
COMING SOON
========================================================================
	Documentation pdf (instead of interspersed in source files and examples).
	See examples/pqRand_Example.cpp or examples/pYqRand_Example.py 
	for examples of using the package.pqRand.hpp is another good resource, ]
	as it is fairly well documented.
	
C++
========================================================================
	This package is designed for GNU/LINUX machines, via a Makefile.
	"make all" should create all examples and a shared library.

	Use the %.x rule as a template to build pqRand into your executable (via libpqr.so).
	Set PQR_DIR to the directory where pqRand lives, then	"make yourExecutable.x". 
	Add needed libraries as necessary.
	Note: LD_LIBRARY_PATH must also point to libpqr.so
	
CYTHON
========================================================================
	Provided you have installed both Python and Cython, 
	it should be possible to easily compile pYqRand, the Python implementation.
	Simply run:
		$ python setup_pYqRand.py build_ext --inplace
	Then you can (provided pYqRand.so is in your directory, or you append sys.path)
		>>> import pYqRand
	
	The Cython interface is the same as the C++ interface.
	The major difference is that we must introduce Seed_FromEngine().
	to replace C++ assigment (operator=), since Python does not copy on assignment.
	See pYqRand_Example.py for a tutorial (and refer to pYqRand.pyx for additional resources).
	
	Note: Cython has only been tested on my CNU/LINUX (CentOS 7, so gcc).
	The '--std=c++11' compiler flag is added to enable C++11 (line 3 of pYqRand.pyx,
	so change this flag to the equivalent one if your compiler doesn't use it).

SEEDING
========================================================================
	pqRand::engine requires 1024 bits of seed. By default (no arg ctor or true),
	it is seeded from std::random_device (/dev/urandom on most linux devices).
	You can supply your own seed (as a file or std::string), 
	but it must be in the right format.
	The recommended seed for auditing is to use automatic seed, 
	then store the seed to a file (~1/3 kB).

	The format of the seed file/string mimics std::mt19937:
	A single line, with each word of seed (64 bits) space separated, 
	terminating with the seed_size itself
		s_1 s_2 s_3 ... s_(state_size) state_size
	Example for PRNG with state_size == 3
		8602057372317241997 13337802638347508439 10520579822156476364 3
	Note that the seed MUST fill the entire state of the PRNG
	( (# of words) == seed_size),  otherwise an exception is thrown.

	NOTE: pqRand::engine contains additional state information.
	Arbitrary states of pqRand_engine can be stored using WriteState,
	and replenished with Seed_FromFile()
