This stripped down version of MathJax is the minimal version that works on my 
GNU/Linux machine. I created it because it's about 200 times smaller than the 
full install, so it's much easier to distribute.
However, I'm almost positive it relies on being able to lookup
certain fonts on your system. If the math in the documentation does not render properly
(i.e. the brief descriptions for all the distributions look like garbage),
there are a couple of things you can do.

1. Edit "doc/Doxyfile" so that
		MATHJAX_RELPATH = https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/
   then run "update" to rebuild the documentation. 
   NOTE: Shortly before publishing, MathJax.org stopped hosting its own cdn, 
   this is the one they suggested, but there's no guarentee it will work.
   
2. If you don't have doxygen (so you can't rebuild documentation), download MathJax from
		docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/installation.html
   Unzip in the doc/ folder and make the softlink "MathJax-minimal" 
   point to the local installation.
