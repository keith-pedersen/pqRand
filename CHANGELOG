////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

version 0.4.3 ===> 14 Jun 2017
========================================================================
	Removed awkward engine::U_S() and renamed engine::U_S_canonical => engine::U_S().
	Renamed uPRNG_64_Seeder => seeded_uPRNG, and PRNG_t::word_size == 32 is now allowed
	(but only if real_t == float).	

version 0.4.2 ===> 12 Jun 2017
========================================================================
	log1p(x/(1-x)) is not more stable than -log1p(-x); 
	both are equally numerically unstable as x => -1.
	Fix distributions which used this trick (standard_normal, exponential, weibull).

version 0.4.1 ===> 18 May 2017
========================================================================
	Fix some portability issues with Makefile and documentation
	(thanks to Nathaniel Beaver).

version 0.4.0 ===> 15 May 2017
========================================================================
	First beta release. Added Doxygen documentation, 
	changed exponential distribution to use rate parameter lambda 
	(instead of mean time mu in, line with convention),
	but then changed all distribution parameter getter functions because
	"lambda" is a reserved word in Python (F8X! $H17 @55),
	created COPYWRITE_NOTICE and CHANGELOG. 
	Note: Some features are still in alpha (e.g. ParallelList).

version 0.2 --- 25 Apr 2017 
========================================================================
	Changed name to pqRand, fixed U_Q to round correctly, 
	pushed paper to arXiv, pushed code to GitHub.
