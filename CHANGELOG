version 0.4.4 ===> 9 Jul 2017
========================================================================
 * Bug fix: v0.4.3 moved the pqRand::PRNG_t typeddef to near the top of pqRand.hpp.
   Unfortunately, this is before xorshift1024_star was defined,
   so the code will not compile without a foward declaration of xorshift1024_star (added).
 * IMPORTANT: Re-licensed pqRand (retroactively) under GPL v3 (see COPYING3) 
   with the GCC Runtime Library Exception, version 3.1 (see COPYING.RUNTIME).
   This move reflects the fact that some of my code (e.g. standard_normal) 
   were modeled after implementations of sampling algorithms found in 
   GNU's bits/random.tcc, thus making my code a "modified version"  
   (and requiring pqRand to use the same license as bits/random.tcc).
   THE UPSHOT: pqRand may still be used inside YOUR closed-source, 
   proprietary software. You can create pqRand objects and call pqRand functions
   provided you build and use pqRand "as-is" and YOUR source code is not 
   directly derivative of the pqRand source code. See COPYRIGHT_NOTICE for a 
   more detailed but plain-worded explanation of the license 
   (and its exception) as I understand them.
 * Retroactively added bullets (*) to CHANGELOG, for readability.

version 0.4.3 ===> 14 Jun 2017
========================================================================
 * Removed awkward engine::U_S() and renamed engine::U_S_canonical => engine::U_S().
 * Renamed uPRNG_64_Seeder => seeded_uPRNG, and PRNG_t::word_size == 32 is now allowed
   (but only if real_t == float).

version 0.4.2 ===> 12 Jun 2017
========================================================================
 * log1p(x/(1-x)) is not more stable than -log1p(-x); 
   both are equally numerically unstable as x => -1.
   Fix distributions which used this trick (standard_normal, exponential, weibull).

version 0.4.1 ===> 18 May 2017
========================================================================
 * Fix some portability issues with Makefile and documentation
   (thanks to Nathaniel Beaver).

version 0.4.0 ===> 15 May 2017  (first beta release)
========================================================================
 * Added Doxygen documentation.
 * Changed exponential distribution to use rate parameter lambda 
   (instead of mean time mu), in line with convention.
   But then changed all distribution parameter getter functions 
   to start with a capital letter because
   "lambda" is a reserved word in Python (F8X! $H17 @55).
 * Created COPYRIGHT_NOTICE and CHANGELOG. 
   Note: Some features are still in alpha (e.g. ParallelList).

changes will be very broadly described, since they are often sweeping


version 0.3 --- 11 May 2017 
========================================================================
 * Changed API for easier transition to Python.
 * namespace pqr->pqRand.
 * Created Cython implementation.
 * Introduced ParallelList functionality (in Cython only) for alpha testing.


version 0.2 --- 25 Apr 2017 
========================================================================
 * Changed name to pqRand.
 * Fixed U_Q to round correctly.
 * Pushed paper to arXiv, pushed code to GitHub.


version 0.1 --- 06 Mar 2017 
========================================================================
 * Package introduced as rTailor; VERY alpha.
